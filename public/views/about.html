		Searching the Internet for information is something we do on a daily basis, particularly when we search for a product or a service we wish to buy. Although using search-engines is the most common solution for finding the product we look for, it is common to be overwhelmed with the great amount of information found online. For instance, when searching for a product, there could be found many websites that offer product reviews which vary from one another by presenting different aspects of the same product.           The main problem consumers face when reading reviews, is the inability to differentiate between what one would consider an advantage of a product, while other would consider it a disadvantage. Also, the vitality of a certain feature changes from one consumer to the other.  Therefore, a suggested solution for this problem would be an analyzing system that couldsummarize the long and tedious reviews that are found online, while also note which aspects are more frequently reported than others. For instance, if only one out of 10 reviews mentioned that a product is easily breakable, it is probable that this specific product is defected or that the reviewer has put the product to an unreasonable use. The system will be based on machine learning techniques in order to create a NLP (Natural Language Processing) solution.  To conclude, websites offer a tremendous amount of information, which could confuse the consumer rather than provide necessary help. We wish to create a system that would be kind with the consumers, with a one-stop solution by automatically analyzing and understanding the positive and negative aspects of products
